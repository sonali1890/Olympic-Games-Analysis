# Olympic-Games-Analysis
Visualize data that will help readers understand how countries have performed historically in the summer Olympic Games.

# Business Problem
The challenge for this data analyst project is outlined below. This has been used repeatedly to confirm that the correct data has been chosen, transformed, and included in the data visualization required for business users.

“As a data analyst working at a news company you are asked to visualize data that will help readers understand how countries have performed historically in the summer Olympic Games. You also know that there is an interest in details about the competitors, so if you find anything interesting then don’t hesitate to bring that in also. The main task is still to show historical performance for different countries, with the possibility to select your own country.”
